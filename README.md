# iot-based-crowd-control-system

IoT-based real-time crowd monitoring system using Arduino UNO and ESP8266 with PIR sensors, smart ventilation control via servo motor, ThingSpeak cloud integration, data visualization, and automated email alerts for overcrowding prevention.

The system ensures accurate bidirectional people counting by preventing double detection, displays live crowd status on an LCD, and supports threshold-based automation for safety management. This project is designed as a low-cost, scalable solution for applications such as classrooms, laboratories, offices, and other small public spaces, with potential extensions to smart building and smart city systems.
